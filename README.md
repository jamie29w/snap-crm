# Snap-CRM

Snap CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) is a responsively designed, lightweight, full stack web app designed with my wife's small photography business in mind. It helps her keep track of the details for her upcoming shoots.

Users can:
- schedule, update, and delete sessions
- include client name, session location, and session-specific notes
- keep track of both quote and deposit payment status
